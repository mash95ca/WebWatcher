Privacy Policy for Web Watcher
Effective Date: July 8, 2025

Introduction
Thank you for using Web Watcher ("the Extension"). This Privacy Policy is here to help you understand what information the Extension handles and why. Our core principle is to protect your privacy. This extension was designed to be a private tool that works entirely on your own computer.

Data Collection and Usage
Web Watcher does not collect, store, transmit, or sell any of your personal data.

All data created and used by the Extension is stored locally on your computer using the chrome.storage.local API. This data is never sent to us or any third-party server. It remains in your browser, under your control.

Information We Use (Stored Locally on Your Computer)
To function correctly, the Extension needs to save the following information on your computer:

Watchlist Data: This includes the website addresses (URLs) you want to watch, the technical information needed to find the element on the page (the XPath expression), user-provided descriptions, and the last value fetched from the page. This is the core data of your watchlist and is essential for the Extension to work.

Settings Data: This includes your preferences, such as your choice of a light or dark theme and your auto-refresh settings. This is stored to ensure the extension remembers how you like it to look and behave.

Permissions Justification
Web Watcher requires certain permissions to provide its features. Here is a clear explanation of why each permission is necessary:

Host Permissions (<all_urls>): This is required for the core functionality of the extension, which is to allow you to right-click and "Watch this element" on any website you choose. The extension only runs a script on a page when you explicitly ask it to by using the context menu.

storage: This permission is necessary to save your watchlist and settings on your local computer.

contextMenus: This allows the extension to add the "Watch this element" option to your right-click menu.

scripting: This is used to get the information from the webpage that you have asked the extension to watch.

alarms: This is used for the "Check for Updates Automatically" feature to work at the interval you set.

downloads: This is required for the "Export CSV" feature to save your watchlist to your computer.

tabs: This allows the extension to fetch data from websites in a background tab without interrupting your browsing.

Third-Party Services
Web Watcher does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy in the future if the extension's functionality changes. We will notify you of any significant changes by updating the policy within the Chrome Web Store listing.
